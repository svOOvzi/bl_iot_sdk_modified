# Rust Firmware for BL602 IoT SDK

[__UPDATE: See the updated firmware in `sdk_app_rust_gpio`__](../sdk_app_rust_gpio)

This BL602 firmware shows how we may create Rust firmware with the BL602 IoT SDK. Read the article...

Rust source code for the BL602 firmware is here...

- [`rust`: Rust source code](rust)

- [`rust_main`: Rust main function](rust/src/lib.rs)

Run this script to build, flash and run the BL602 Rust firmware...

This script links the compiled Rust code into the BL602 firmware by overwriting the compiled `rust_app` Stub Library...

The script uses a Custom Rust Target `riscv32imacf-unknown-none-elf`...

- [`riscv32imacf-unknown-none-elf.json`: Rust Target for BL602](riscv32imacf-unknown-none-elf.json)

This Custom Rust Target is a minor tweak of the standard Rust target `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf`...

1. We set `features` to `+m,+a,+c,+f` to generate RISC-V binaries with Single-Precision Hardware Floating-Point (`+f`)

1. We set `llvm-abiname` to `ilp32f` to support Single-Precision Hardware Floating-Point for the Application Binary Interface

We can't use the standard target `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf` because...

1. BL602 IoT SDK was compiled with `gcc -march=rv32imfc -mabi=ilp32f`

   (Single-Precision Hardware Floating-Point)

1. Linker fails with error `can't link soft-float modules with single-float modules`

How did we figure out the tweaks for the Custom Rust Target?

By comparing the Rust Target Specs for `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf` vs `riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf`...

1.  [`riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf.json`: 32-bit RISC-V with software floating point](customer_app/sdk_app_rust/riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf.json)

    ```bash
    rustc +nightly -Z unstable-options --print target-spec-json --target riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf
    ```

1.  [`riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf.json`: 64-bit RISC-V with double-precision hardware floating point](customer_app/sdk_app_rust/riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf.json)
